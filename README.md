### Deployment

My goal is to learn how to deploy a rails app to a remote linux server.

For this, I will use Linode as the hosting provider and the latest Ubuntu version.

In the future, I would like to learn how to dockerize a Rails app and deploy it
using Google Cloud Run.

Deploying a Rails app to Heroku is easier than the two others options but
because I have already done it a few times, I really wanted to learn something new
with this project.
